### Introduction
International trade is an essential part of agricultural markets in the United States. As the spread of Covid-19 rattled the global economy, both directly and through necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus, the food and agriculture sector was also disrupted by this global health crisis. The uncertainty associated with the possible impacts on the food supply and demand chain has no doubt pressure on food prices globally since 2020. In this project, we will investigate the impact of Covid-19 on U.S. agricultural trade using data gathered from the Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) data from 2018 to 2021 and the Public COVID-19 daily report by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.
