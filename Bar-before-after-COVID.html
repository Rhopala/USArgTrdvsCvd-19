<h3>Average Import Value Before/After Covid From 2018 To 2021</h3>
<p>The plot below shows the United States’ average import value by product type before and after Covid-19. In general, the average import values increased by approximately 16.53% after Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the products’ import value, such as fruits and preparations, Cotton and linters, beef and veal, coca and products, vegetable oils, oilseeds and products and red meats and products, have all increased by more than 20%. In addition, it is interesting to note that both distilled spirits and manufactured tobacco are only imported after the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Average Export Value Before/After Covid From 2018 To 2021</h3>
<p>This plot shows the United States’ average export values by product type before and after Covid-19. In general, the average export values increased by approximately 18.44% after Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the products’ export value, such as corn, soybeans, dairy products, other oilseeds, and grains and feeds, have all increased by more than 20%. It is interesting to notice that ethanol, which is a renewable fuel made from corn and other plants, tobacco, distilled spirits, are only exported to other countries after the pandemic.</p>
